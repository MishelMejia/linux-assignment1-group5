The kernel is the core part of the operating system that controls hardware and system resources. The shell is a program that lets users type commands to interact with the kernel.

An absolute path shows the full location of a file starting from the root / (for example, /home/group5/docs). A relative path shows the location based on where you are currently in the system (for example, ../notes).
